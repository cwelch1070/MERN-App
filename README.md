# MERN-App

## About this project
I built this project following a tutorial for the MERN stack. I learned alot building out this application and gained basic knowledge of a variety of technologies.
These technologies include MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, Node.js, Node Package Manager, GIT, and Postman.

## What it does
The program is a web application that allows a user to create and delete goals. The user can also create an account and the goals that user creates is bound to that 
user. Users cannot tamper with another users profile due to the use of token authentication.
